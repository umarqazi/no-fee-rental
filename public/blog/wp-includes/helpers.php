 * file will then load the wp-settings.php file, which
 * will then set up the WordPress environment.
 *
 * If the wp-config.php file is not found then an error
 * will be displayed asking the visitor to set up the
 * wp-config.php file.
 *
 * Will also search for wp-config.php in WordPress' parent
 * directory to allow the WordPress directory to remain
