Modal contact / feedback form designed "the Apple way".

== Description ==

Usernoise is a "just works" modal contact / feedback form. It became responsive starting from 3.5 release.
You will not need to change even a line of code in your site.

= Demo =
Usernoise demo is available at [usernoise.karevn.com](http://usernoise.karevn.com) - a "Feedback" button at the left.

= Go Pro =
__[Usernoise Pro](http://codecanyon.net/item/usernoise-pro-advanced-modal-feedback-debug/1420436?ref=karevn)__ adds even more features, like:

* Public feedback comments
* CSS customization for every piece of public interface.
* Advanced debug info gathered along with feedback
* Ability to use custom Feedback buttons without code modifications.
* Second email for admin notifications.
* [usernoise] form shortcode to embed the form right into WP pages or posts.


= Features =
* Adds a customizable "Feedback" button and modal form to your site.
* Responsive!
* Bullet-proof visual design will work with any site template.
* Spam-proof. Usernoise is designed in such a way that most of spam bots can't see its form.
* Admin notifications, feedback archive available at admin area.
* Modal window can be controlled by Javascript API.
* __On-page forms added in 3.0__
* Lots, lots of options.
* Highest performance possible. From 2.0 release, Usernoise only adds a small link to your site's HTML.

= Compatibility =
* IE7+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, Safari on iPad supported.
* Usernoise can be disabled on mobile devices.

= Translations =
If you need Usernoise in your language which is not supported currently - you can help Usernoise by 
translating it. Don't worry, translating is extremely easy - just [download a localization template](http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/usernoise/languages/usernoise.pot), edit it with your favorite text editor and send to email karev.n (at) gmail dot com. Your help will be really appreciated.

= Support =
Having problems or need support? Feel free to email me - cherry (dot) dev (at) gmail (dot) com or [open a support topic](http://wordpress.org/tags/usernoise?forum_id=10#postform).

== Installation ==

1. Upload `usernoise` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to Settings - Usernoise in admin area of your site, set it up to your needs.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. **Usernoise button does not show after installation** - <strong>Check if your theme has `<?php wp_head(); ?>`</strong> call at `header.php`. Also check if some of your plugins install their own jQuery versions. Feel free to contact me for help.
2. **I have problems with notification email delivery** - It is a generic WordPress problem with outgoing emails. You can use [All In One Email plugin](http://codecanyon.net/item/all-in-one-email-for-wordpress/1290390) to fix it and have HTML emails instead of plain text.
3. **Can I open a feedback window using some other button?** - yes, you just need to upgrade to [Usernoise Pro](http://codecanyon.net/item/usernoise-pro-advanced-modal-feedback-debug/1420436).
4. **When I fill the feedback form and click "Submit feedback" button - the loader spins, and nothing happens** - most probably, you have `define('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true);` in your `wp-config.php`, also check if you have Site Url option at the general settings page equal to actual site url (www prefix matters!).
4. **Is Usernoise spam-proof?** -- Yes, it almost is. Let me know if you are receiving a lot of spam with Usernoise - I'll try to help.
5. **I need Usernoise in my language** - [Download a localization template](http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/usernoise/languages/usernoise.pot), edit it with your favorite text editor, and send me to `karev.n (at) gmail dot com`. I will include your translation and credits into the next Usernoise release. It takes 2-3 days usually.
7. **Can I add some custom fields to Usernoise form?** - Yes, you can, but it requires some coding skills. Use `un_feedback_form_body` action and `un_validate_feedback` filter.
8. **Usernoise is missing /some feature/** - Feel free to contact me! I really appreciate new ideas.
