                        <p>Start your search 30-45 days before your desired move-in date.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>The market changes fast, and if a search is begun too soon or too late, then you may not have access to the most current inventory. Typically, landlords will know their upcoming available apartments about a month in advance of a vacancy. Anything you see more than 45 days before your move might be off the market as your timeline approaches.</p>

                        <p><strong>A few months before you move, you can prioritize your needs and research your desired neighborhood.</strong></p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>Determine what is most important for your future home, including apartment size, amenities, location and budget. Deciding which neighborhood, subway lines, and school zones you prefer will help to narrow down a future search.</p>

                            <li>When scheduling an apartment viewing, make sure it is done together – if an apartment is viewed separately, it will likely be gone by the time your other roommate has the time to see it.</li>

                            <li>If you don’t meet the landlord’s income requirements and cannot find a guarantor, one option is to try offering an increased security deposit to make up for it. (Note: By law, rent-stabilized buildings can only accept one month’s security deposit, so these units may not be an option)</li>
                            <li>A third party company can be hired to act as a guarantor.</li>
